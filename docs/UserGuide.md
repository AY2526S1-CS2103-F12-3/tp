# CaseTrack User Guide

CaseTrack is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a  Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CaseTrack can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for CaseTrack.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar casetrack.jar` command to run the application.<br>

   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 i/1200` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the CaseTrack.

   * `delete patient 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Parameter Constraints

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about parameter formats:**<br>

* **NAME**: Should only contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, periods (.), apostrophes ('), hyphens (-), 's/o', 'd/o', 'S/O', or 'D/O', and it should not be blank.

    * Hyphens or spaces within the main number (e.g., `1234-5678`, `1234 5678`)
    * Labels or text in parentheses (e.g., `91234567 (HP)`, `1234 5678 (Office)`)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note on Duplicate Patients:**
CaseTrack prevents adding duplicate patients. A patient is considered a duplicate if **both** the name and phone number match an existing patient:
- Name matching is **case-insensitive** (e.g., "John Doe" = "john doe")
- Extra spaces in names are ignored (e.g., "John Doe" = "John  Doe")
- Multiple patients can share the same name if they have different phone numbers
- Multiple patients can share the same phone number if they have different names

Examples:
- ✅ Allowed: "John Doe" (91234567) and "John Doe" (98765432) - same name, different phone
- ✅ Allowed: "John Doe" (91234567) and "Jane Doe" (91234567) - different name, same phone
- ❌ Blocked: "John Doe" (91234567) and "john doe" (91234567) - duplicate (case-insensitive match)
- ❌ Blocked: "John Doe" (91234567) and "John  Doe" (91234567) - duplicate (whitespace ignored)

</box>

### Listing all patients : `list`

Shows a list of all patients in the CaseTrack.

Format: `list`

### Editing a patient : `edit patient`

Edits an existing patient in the CaseTrack.

Format: `edit patient <PATIENT_INDEX> [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [i/INCOME] [m/MEDICAL_INFO] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the patient at the specified `PATIENT_INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed patient list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing names, they should only contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, periods (.), apostrophes ('), hyphens (-), 's/o', 'd/o', 'S/O', or 'D/O', and cannot be fully numeric.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the patient will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the patient's tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
*  `edit patient 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st patient to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

### Locating persons: `search`

Finds persons whose specified field contains any of the given keywords.

  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
* Supported fields: `name`, `number`, `email`, `tag`

**Matching behavior varies by field:**
* **Name search**: Only full words will be matched. Each word in multi-word names is matched independently.
  e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`, but `Hans` will match `Hans Gruber`
* **Number search**: Partial matches are supported. e.g. `9123` will match `91234567`
* **Email search**: Partial matches are supported. e.g. `alice` will match `alice@example.com`

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, CaseTrack will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause CaseTrack to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CaseTrack home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
